    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

    <p>This is the first paragraph. It introduces the purpose of the site and gives a short welcome message to visitors.</p>

    <h2>About This Project</h2>

    <p>This is the second paragraph. Here I briefly explain what I'm learning and why I'm building this portfolio as a practice project.</p>

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>

    <p>This is the third paragraph. I talk about HTML basics: structure, headings, paragraphs, images, and how these elements form a simple page.</p>

    <p>This is the fourth paragraph. I include a clickable image below that links to an external site; clicking it will open the target URL in the current tab.</p>

    <!-- Clickable image: replace href with any target; using the provided image src -->
    <a href="https://www.alx.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
